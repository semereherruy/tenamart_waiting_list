## ‚úÖ API Testing with Postman

Import the `postman_collection.json` (if available) or use the following endpoints manually:

### üîê Auth Routes

| Method | URL           | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| POST   | /api/register | Register a user                |
| POST   | /api/login    | Login a user                   |
| GET    | /api/user     | Get user details *(protected)* |
| POST   | /api/logout   | Logout *(protected)*           |

**Headers for protected routes:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
```

## üì¨ Email Sending

We use Mailtrap for local testing.

A scheduled command will send weekly reports:

```bash
php artisan report:weekly-waiting-list
```

### If you want to test it manually:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
$user = App\Models\User::first();
Mail::to($user->email)->send(new App\Mail\WeeklyReportMail($user));
```

## üß† Project Logic & Decisions

* **Sanctum** is chosen for simple token-based API authentication.
* Custom `SendWeeklyReport` command was built to demonstrate Laravel's scheduler and email logic.
* Emails are handled via Mailtrap for safe, local testing.
* Clean code architecture and proper naming conventions are followed.
* Error handling and validation are in place for all API endpoints.
